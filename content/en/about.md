Hi! I am Hackfight (or HaccFight in some cases), a bilingual, 18 years old, self-thaught gamedev from Switzerland.

I am currently doing a Bachelor in computer science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). \
\
**Game developement:** \
Video games being my main interest, it is the domain in which I am the most skillful. I use Unity for most of my video games but I have also used other engines such as GameMaker or Godot. I have also interested myself in making games from scratch in C++ with different graphics API. To see some of my games see my [Itch.io](https://hackfight.itch.io). Even though none of them are publicly availabe I also make VR games. \
\
**Team Work:** \
I usually try to work on projects with multiple people. I am one of the founders of [SwissCommunities](https://swisscommunities.ch), which is a community centered around french speaking Switzerland on the internet. I have also trained my skill of team work at events such as the [Swiss Game Academy](https://gameacademy.ch/SGA/) and I am currently staffing for [Game*](https://clicgamestar.ch/) at EPFL. \
\
**Other:** \
To be a jack-of-all-trades I need a bit more than three bullet points, so here is the rest: \
Minecraft not only being my childhood game it is also where I learnt coding. I am then able to code [datapacks](https://modrinth.com:2053/datapack/ore-crops), plugins, [shaders](https://modrinth.com:2053/shader/btb-back-to-basics) and [mods](https://modrinth.com:2053/mod/create-switzerland). The combination of Minecraft and SwissCommunities also thaught me the basics of servers and internet protocols. And of course, I also know a bit of web developement and computer structures (I built an 8-bit computer in Minecraft). I also took the time to build my social media accounts and setup streams even though I do not use them actively. \
\
**Hobbies:** \
Obviously I am a big fan of coding stuff, I would not be here otherwise. I am also a fan of automation, indie and parkour games. I also recently started to play competitive games. \
To push even more the geek stereotype I have studied physics aswell as biology and gave myself a challenge by studying one year abroad. \
I like to take care of all kinds of animals especially the weird ones. I take care of stickbugs, a blob, my cat and a few axolotls. I am partially active in the furry fandom where I updated my electronics skills to make a protogen head. :3 \
Otherwise I love watching different films and series, listening to music and I am making my first steps into cosplaying. \
Leaving the geek stereotypes and entering the swiss ones I love chocolate, the mountains and snow. I praticed a lot of different sports: in the mountains, on the water and under the water. \
\
**Online presence:** \

 My personal projects usually fall in a big range of tech stuff, but the projects I post publicly are usually around video games and visuals. You can find most of my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/HackFight), my [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/HackFight) and my [Itch.io](https://hackfight.itch.io). You should also go check my very good friend, [PadjokeJ's, website](https://padjokej.dev/) as we work on a lot of project together. \
