                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>Hi! I am <span>Hackfight</span>, a <span class="text-color" id="age">17</span> years old developer from Switzerland and I speak English and French.</p>
                        <p>
                            I have been learning how to code by myself since I was eleven and I will soon join the EPFL to learn the proper ways of coding.</p>As a curious person I have always been interested in how everything works but video games and computers truly captivated my attention. I started using command blocks in Minecraft and since then I have learnt much more, making me a jack-of-all-trades in computers.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>What I am good at</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <div><h3>Game developement</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Video game being my main interest, it is the domain in which I am the most skillful. I use <span>Unity</span> for most of
                                    my my video games but I have also used other engines such as <span>GameMaker</span>. I have also interested myself
                                    in making my own game engine in <span>C++</span> with <span>OpenGL</span>. To see some of my games see my <a href="https://hackfight.itch.io">Itch.io</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>Even though none of them are publibly availabe I also make <span>VR</span> games which their complexity only make
                                    me more passionate for game developement.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div><h3>Design</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Code is fun but I prefer when it also has a visual aspect, and because I have not yet found the time to learn all the different artistic skills of this universe, I have chosen design. For me, design inludes different categories of design like <span>web design</span> or <span>game design</span>.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div><h3>Team Management</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I believe that no one can work as well as with a team. This is why I usually try to work on projects with
                                    multiple people and it is also why I am one of the founders of <a href="https://swisscommunities.github.io">SwissCommunities</a>. Which is a community
                                    centered around french speaking Switzerland on the internet. I have also trained my skill of team work at
                                    events such as the <a href="https://gameacademy.ch/SGA/">Swiss Game Academy</a> which is a presential game jam.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div><h3>Other</h3>
                                <p>To be a jack-of-all-trades I need a bit more than three bullet points, so here is the rest:</p>
                                <p>
                                    Minecraft not only being my childhood game it is also where I learnt coding I am then able to code
                                    <span>datapacks</span>, <span>plugins</span> and <span>mods</span>. The combination of Minecraft and <a href="https://swisscommunities.github.io">SwissCommunities</a> also thaught me the
                                    basics of <span>servers</span> and <span>internet protocols</span>. And of course I also know a bit of <span>web developement</span> and computer structures <i>(I built an 8-bit computer in Minecraft)</i>. I also took
                                    the time to build my social media accounts and setup streams even though I do not use them actively.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                        <p>
                            Obviously I am a big fan of coding stuff, I would not be here otherwise. I am also a fan of automation, inde and
                            parkour games. I also recently started to play competitive games.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To push even more the geek stereotype I am studying for a physics degree and gave myself a challenge by
                            studying one year abroad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I like to take care of all kinds of animals especially the weird ones. I take care of stickbugs, a blob, my cat and a
                            few axolotls. Inevitably my interest for animals led me to the furry fandom where I met a few nice people that I
                            kidnapped and called them friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Otherwise I love watching different films and series <i>(Arcane my beloved)</i>, listening to music and I am making
                            my first steps into cosplaying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leaving the geek stereotypes and entering the swiss ones I love chocolate, the mountains and snow. I praticed a lot of
                            different sports: in the mountains, on the water and under the water. And I play piano.
                        </p>
